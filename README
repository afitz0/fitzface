This is Fitz's code for his personal website. It's an experiment in doing a
website in C and is, by a long shot, not meant to be the "best" way of doing
a site, and is very much a work in progress.

Once the whole thing is reasonably done, I'm probably going to redo the whole
thing in a language I don't have experience in. Ruby's a likely candidate.

Nothing within this project is meant to be part of an "application" or
